- Okie !!! AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAA-... ME VERY ANGRY ! ÔΩ°¬∞(¬∞¬Ø·∑Ñ‚ó†¬Ø·∑Ö¬∞)¬∞ÔΩ°
- So, me recently contacted the "SoundCloud" support team for API access to add suport for SoundCloud in [yutify](https://github.com/CheapNightbot/yutify) ando [yutipy](https://github.com/CheapNightbot/yutipy)... (Àµ¬†¬¨·¥ó¬¨Àµ)
    - Yosh, you have to contact them using chat overlay thingy talking with bot support assistant which will then create a ticket for you then a "human" will check that ticket ando contact you back just to say "f**k you" to yu in the most human language that ever existed... Âá∏( ‚Ä¢ÃÄ_‚Ä¢ÃÅ )Âá∏
- Anywa- "( ‚Äì ‚åì ‚Äì )
- After doing that support ticket thingy, me 2 days ago got reply from them.. (‚âñ‚©ä‚âñ)
- Yes, unfortunately me did not get access to SoundCloud API, because: ‚Ä¢·¥ó‚Ä¢
    - > "Due to a high number of spammers, trying to get access to and abusing our APIs, we decided to no longer grant API access to very new or inactive accounts."
- Solution: ‚Ä¢·¥ó‚Ä¢
    - > "If you just started on SoundCloud, go ahead for a while - like some tracks, create a playlist, comment on a track or even upload your own first track. After that, please reach back out to us, so we can see that your account is used with genuine intention."
    - Can't a freakin "spammer" do that ? (Àµ¬†¬¨·¥ó¬¨Àµ)
- But that is not why me angry.. me can understand. It's their product, they invested in that, they pay for keeping it up ando it's their sole choice who gets access, etc. ‡¥¶‡µç‡¥¶‡¥øÔºà‚Ä¢ Àï ‚Ä¢„Éû.·êü
- The thing that triggered me was this:
    - > "Also: I see <u>on your website</u> that <u>you are monetising these tools</u> - unfortunately, our public API cannot be used for commercial use cases."
    - "monetising definition" according to Google sensei:
    - {{ img(id="/journal/2025, 09 July/'monetising definition' according to Google sensei.png", alt="'monetising definition' according to Google sensei", title="'monetising definition' according to Google sensei", width="612", height="73", class="center") }}
- WHAT DA *\<CENSORED\>* ( ‚ïπ -‚ïπ)!!?
- What "monetising" ?? Where "meonetizing" ??? Which "your website" !!!? ( ,,‚©å'Ô∏ø'‚©å,,)
- It's freakin open-source ando FREE.. even my own website including this one where writing is open-source... just tell me where yu see "monetizing" ??? (¬¨_¬¨")
- I never monetized anything ever in my life.. me not create for money, me create cause it solved a problem for me or my friendo !!! or me couldn't find solution to problem me got !!! (‚∏ù‚∏ù‚∏ù>Ôπè<‚∏ù‚∏ù‚∏ù)
- Now there is no need.. me don't need your API ~ very very thank you ! ‡≤•Ôπè‡≤•
- I'm gonna delete the account as well.. („Å£ÀÉÃ£Ã£Ã• -ÀÇÃ£Ã£Ã•œÇ)

- AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAA~ !!!! („Å§‚âß‚ñΩ‚â¶)„Å§
- Okie, finally [yutify](https://github.com/CheapNightbot/yutify) finished !!
    - Me mean, there's always places to improve it, there might be some unknown bugs, etc... (‚∏ù‚∏ù·µï·¥ó·µï‚∏ù‚∏ù)
    - But it has everything needed ando works as expected ! ( ‡πë ÀÉÃµ·¥óÀÇÃµ)Ÿà ‚ô°
- Ow, waito ~ did me tell **me bought a domain** ?? OwO
- WAAAAAAAAAA- how can me forget ( À∂¬∞„ÖÅ¬∞) !!!!?????
- So, yea... me bought domain !!! ( ‚Ä¢ ÃÄœâ‚Ä¢ÃÅ )‚úß
    - [**https://cheapnightbot.me**](https://cheapnightbot.me) !!!!! ÀéÀäÀó
    - It only for 1 year ~ (Àµ¬†¬¨·¥ó¬¨Àµ)
- Wat else ‚àò ‚àò ‚àò ( ¬∞„ÉÆ¬∞ ) ????
- ow ow.. also, created personal website using [Astro](https://astro.build) (FINALLY !!!) ~ ‡∏Ö^>‚©ä<^ ‡∏Ö
    - like, it still not complete.. but me learning ando building it at the same time.. (‚Äû‚Ä¢ ÷ä ‚Ä¢‚Äû)‡©≠
    - nice nice // cool cool !! ‡¥¶‡µç‡¥¶‡¥ø(·µî·óú·µî)
- Also, yestarday when updated/deployed the yutify.. the GitHub listening activity SVG was not updating. (¬¨`‚Ä∏¬¥¬¨)
    - Me was like why !! it my issue or GitHub ?? (ÔΩ°¬∑  v  ¬∑ÔΩ°) ?
    - Me knew GitHub caches images in readme file, but i had `no-store` "Cache-Control` header set !  („Å£'„ÉÆ'c)
    - Yosh, `no-store`, **NOT** the `no-cache` !! ‚Ä¢·¥ó‚Ä¢
        - As mentioned in the MDN docs:
        > "Note that no-cache does not mean "don't cache". no-cache allows caches to store a response but requires them to revalidate it before reuse. If the sense of "don't cache" that you want is actually "don't store", then no-store is the directive to use."
    - Then search [on StackOverflow](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/26898052/how-to-force-image-cache-update-in-readme-rst-on-github) ando this was the solution:
        - ```bash
          curl -X PURGE {url of cached image}
          ```
    - Like, waaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaa- !! yu don't know how many times me force refresh browser, update header, etc. !!!! BAKA !! (¬¨_¬¨")
- AAAAAAAAAAAAAA~ okie, BYE !!!! /·ê† Àµ> Àï <Àµ„Éû

- Was very busy with stuffs ! ( Í©ú ·ØÖ Í©ú;)‚Å≠ ‚Å≠
- Ow, yea- applied to another internship (not finished yet) today // x minutes ago ! Ÿ©(^·óú^ )Ÿà ¬¥-
    - Ando, honestly, it was the most interesting and challenging (well there was a challenge ~ meow) ! ‡¥¶‡µç‡¥¶‡¥ø ÀâÕàÃÄÍí≥ÀâÕàÃÅ )‚úß
    - It took two days to finish w (,,>„ÉÆ<,,)!
- Ah, also... the reason not writing here // not wrote here for almost two months is that me want to create proper site with journal section there (most probably with Astro) ando working on that.. ‚Çç^. .^‚Çé‚üÜ
    - I thought instead of keep writing here and move all stuff there, why not write directly there.. (‚Äû‚Ä¢ ÷ä ‚Ä¢‚Äû)
    - wait- wat ? ‚àò ‚àò ‚àò ( ¬∞„ÉÆ¬∞ ) ?

- Waaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaa, meow ~!!!!!!!!! /·ê†Àµ- ‚©ä -Àµ„Éû
- Yestarday me released a Python package on [pypi](https://pypi.org/project/yutipy/) ~!! ·ïô( ‚Ä¢ÃÄ ·óú ‚Ä¢ÃÅ )·ïó
    - This is the first time me done it. (>/////< " )
    - Tried before (few years ago), but got overwhelmed by it and couldn't. (‚∏ù‚∏ù‚∏ù>Ôπè<‚∏ù‚∏ù‚∏ù)
    - But now me finally did that realized it's not that hard and stuff ! ( ‡πë ÀÉÃµ·¥óÀÇÃµ)Ÿà ‚ô°
    - AAAAAAAaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaa, so happy and proud to be a potato kid !! wwww- (‡πë‚âß‚ñΩ‚â¶‡πë)o
- But honestly, hated the sign up process (for a reason !), okie dokie- forget ! (‚∏ù‚∏ù‚ï∏-‚ï∫‚∏ù‚∏ù)
- Ow, the package that me released is the [yutipy](https://github.com/CheapNightbot/yutipy). Ÿ©( ·êõ )Ÿà
    - Sounds familiar? ( ‚âñ‚Äø  ‚âñ )
    - hm hm, me separated the part which communicates with APIs into separate project ("**separation of concerns**" !!) from yutify, which made it easier to write tests as well ! ‡¥¶‡µç‡¥¶‡¥ø/·ê†ÔΩ°‚Ä∏ÔΩ°·êü\
    - Also it good for long term maintainance ~ ( ÀÜêÉ∑ÀÜ) .·êü.·êü
    - So, then me decided to made it into package for easier use with "yutify" project. ‚Ä¢·¥ó‚Ä¢
- Beside that, now anyone else can use yutipy. Ÿ©(^·óú^ )Ÿà ¬¥-
- But someone might think "why use yutipy when there are similar and more feature full + powerful libraries?" ~ (·µï‚Äî·¥ó‚Äî)
    - That's the point! (ÀäÕà Íí≥ ÀãÕà)
    - "yutipy" isn't "feature full" or "powerful", it's "simple" ! (Àµ ‚Ä¢ÃÄ ·¥ó - Àµ ) ‚úß
    - Like, you just want to search & retrieve info from music platforms, then why you want to get stuffed with features like login, playlist creation, etc. ‚àò ‚àò ‚àò ( ¬∞„ÉÆ¬∞ ) ?
    - All the configurations, setup, etc... so complicated. (¬¨_¬¨")
    - But with "yutipy": install it, import it, use it, you have the info ! That's it.. no setup required, except getting credentials for Spotify and putting them in `.env` file. Rest the library will handle. No need to worry about manally using `python-dotenv` to load them. No need to worry about getting "access token" and stuff.. just search ! ‡¥¶‡µç‡¥¶‡¥ø ‚Ä¢‚©ä‚Ä¢ )
- AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAa- .¬∑¬∞’û(ÀÉ ·óù ÀÇ)’û¬∞¬∑.
- Aaniwey ~ (‚äô _ ‚äô )
- Fun fact: me was awake for almost 24 hours yestardy working on yutipy and releasing it on pypi ... (Àä·µíÃ¥Ã∂Ã∑Ã§ Íá¥ ·µíÃ¥Ã∂Ã∑Ã§Àã)
    - As soon as me released it, me went to sleep (sooooooooo sleepy TwT) !! (‚∏ù‚∏ù·¥óÔπè·¥ó‚∏ù‚∏ù) ·∂ª ùóì ê∞Å
    - That why couldn't write yestarday ~ ( ‚ó°ÃÄ_‚ó°ÃÅ)

- Aaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaa ~ q(‚âß‚ñΩ‚â¶q)
- So, me been working a website ando created a "splash screen". (¬¥ÔΩ°‚Ä¢ œâ ‚Ä¢ÔΩ°`)
    - It simple white overlay that fads out in 2 seconds~ (ÔºÉÔø£œâÔø£)
    - When someone visits the website, it show.	|_„Éª)
    - BUT, da problem was it was showing all the time- Âá∏(Ôø£„ÉòÔø£)
    - Me mean, when navigate through pages or refresh da page, it show - !! (Ôø¢_Ôø¢;)
    - Which was annoying ~ 	(Ôºõ‚å£ÃÄ_‚å£ÃÅ)
    - Using JavaScript for the showing - hiding logic btw ~ ‚Ä¢‚©ä‚Ä¢
- Then, the solution for this me think (as one might think) was:
    - Use `localStorage` to store a variable (boolean probably!) with value `true`.
    - Show user the splash screen once ando then set variable to `false`.
    - If variable `null` or `true`, show splash otherwise don't show.
- Me thought it will work- ( = ‚©ä = )
    - But didn't work, aaaaaaaaaaaa ~ (ÔΩ°‚Ä¢ÃÄ ‚§ô ‚Ä¢ÃÅ ÔΩ°Íê¶) !!!
    - Even if it work, you never gonna show the user splash again until they clear the browser history, site data, etc. \_:(¬¥‡ΩÄ`„Äç ‚à†):\_
    - Ando, then me thought of setting the variable again to `true` on tab or browser close.
    - Only thing me could found was `unload` event, but didn't work as it deprecated. („Éª„Éª;)„Çû
- Searching online, everyone was seems to be suggesting either same thing or cookies ~ ‡¥¶‡µç‡¥¶‡¥ø/·ê†ÔΩ°‚Ä∏ÔΩ°·êü\
- BUT YU KNOW WAT WAS DA SOLUTION, meow ‡∏Ö^ >„ÉÆ<^‚Çé ?
    - `sessionStorage` !!!! ‚ô°(ÀÉÕà ÀÇÕà )
    - Hm hm, it seems to be similar to `localStorage`, but the thing makes it perfect is:
    - The data store in it remains to that tab session and gets cleared on that tab close.
    - Me also didn't notice it getting cleared on page refresh (so far didn't), but can be cleared in some cases, idk ~ (ÔΩ°√ìÔπè√íÔΩ°)
- Wa- this todays journal was all about "splash screen" ? \*dies from flash..\* \_(:3„Äç‚à†)\_

- Ow, btw, forgot to write earlier; I wanted to document my CS50 journey, but couldn't cause of personal/family issues. /_ \ anyway...
- Now, the thing is, for so long I wanted to create my own music player!!!!!! ‚ô™(¬¥‚ñΩÔΩÄ)
    - I don't remember for how long. Like, it has been the ultimate goal and dream of mine, but couldn't get my feet wet. OwO
    - Well, did try to make it happen, but really I had no such tools in my toolbox to make it happen. (#_<-)
    - So, now I do have such tools, but still it's unclear which one to use. O.O
- The problem is there is no right answer!! \`(\*>Ôπè<\*)‚Ä≤
    - I mean, there is no one way and tool to solve this problem. I can literally create a PWA or something similar and be done with it. (Àâ‚ñΩÀâÔºõ)...
    - But I don't want to create a web app (there are alreay so many) !! I want to creat a native desktop application (software!) !! ( ‚Ä¢ÃÄ œâ ‚Ä¢ÃÅ )‚úß
    - AND THERE IS NO CLEAR ANSWER! (Àâ‚ñΩÀâÔºõ)...
- At the moment, I don't care about any other OS than Windows. (. ‚ùõ ·¥ó ‚ùõ.)
    - If I look at ways to solve this problem for Windows alone, there are so many way; UWP, .NET, Win32, MFC... aaaaaaaaaaaa~!!!!!! Œµ=Œµ=Œµ=‚îè(„Çú„É≠„Çú;)‚îõ
    - And looking at these, I have no idea what to do !!!! (ÀâÔπÉÀâ)

- AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAA~!!!!
- Today is really really really special for me!!!!!!!
- I never want to forget this day!!!!!!!!!
- Today. I can say. "I took CS50" !
- I can not explain how much confident I do feel right now. It's been a long journey and there were a lot of times when I felt like I will not be able to make it. Even thought (somewhat stumid) that CS is not for me that's why I got forced to take Biology. But I am able to prove myself wrong today.
- As Prof. Malan said, "It's not about where you end up relative to your classmate, but where you end up relative to yourself prior taking this class". And if I look back, it all makes much more sense right now. I did notice as working my way through the course, every next assignment, I found myself thinking more about the "problem" than the "solution".
    - 'Cause, there are a lot of ways to solve a single problem, but what ultimately matters is "how you approach and solve the problem".
- I don't know if I make any sense or not..
- Now, I am left with void and a single thought, "what you want to do now? what can you do to solve world's problems? how can you be worth? what something you can do to bring some value to this world?"...
- Well, learning never ends..
- Ow, if I look back to "{{ date_format(date="2024-05-01") }}" when I started CS50, it's been **152 days** OR **4 months, 29 days**.

- Aaaaaaa~! Finally me back writting my Journal !!!! (ÔΩ°T œâ TÔΩ°)
- Due to a lot of things happening, I couldn't write my Journal.
- Anyway!
- I have a lot to write, but let's forget the past and write about today!
- So, just (it's been an hour) submited my assignments/problem set for the Week 5 (ahm- 0 index so to speak!) and I feel like a wizard yet "nothing is magic. everything is where you expect it to be.".
- The thing is, I was little afraid and nervous for the "Speller" one. But I was able to solve it in under a day, in one sitting.
    - And what makes me feel "wizard" is, my implementation, though was taking `0.07` total time in compare to staff's implementation taking `0.05`. BUT, where staff's implementation was taking `0.01` in unload, mine takes `0.00`. <(Ôø£Ô∏∂Ôø£)>
- Ow, I noticed some things have changed in **Zola** (the SSG I am using!) as it didn't work right away after cloning the repo and running *zola serve*. (“Ç‚å£ÃÄ_‚å£ÃÅ)
    - It was showing errors. So I had to change few configs. [ ¬± _ ¬± ]
    - But me happy that I had wrote *bash scripts* for automating Journal & Blog entries. That's why I didn't have to figure it out how to start my Journal after not writting it for quite a while.
    - Just run script and it opens **vim** with everything ready for me to start writting. (‚ÅÑ ‚ÅÑ‚Ä¢‚ÅÑœâ‚ÅÑ‚Ä¢‚ÅÑ ‚ÅÑ)

- Then, at 3 o'clock morning, I made myself a ginger tea. And it was really good and warm. It did helped little in cold, but my body still burning.
- So, I opened X (Twitter) and saw post + repost (thank you !!) in my "Following" tab / timeline.
    - Ow, speaking of timeline on Twitter, I always stay in "Following" tab.. „Äú‚Å†(‚Å†Íí™‚Å†Íí≥‚Å†Íí™‚Å†)‚Å†„Äú

    - I had previously taken the [Introduction to Windows Subsystem for Linux (WSL)](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/training/modules/wsl-introduction/) learning module on **Microsoft Learn** + had learnt about **WSL** from docs + had same/similar issue few years ago AND immediately knew what's wrong and replied them ("Anonymous") with the solution ! 	___„ÄÜ(„Éª‚àÄ„Éª)
    - As expected, it worked for them / the problem solved and they replied with "Thank you..":

    - Aaaaaaaaaaaaaaa- you know the happiness you get when you help someone and the confidence you earn from it !! 	(‚ÅÑ ‚ÅÑ>‚ÅÑ ‚ñΩ ‚ÅÑ<‚ÅÑ ‚ÅÑ)
- I might write (kind of) Blog about this problem and solution (maybe it will be helpful for someone or maybe for me in the future) soon‚Ñ¢, when I get time.
- So, two Blogs on to-do.. XD
    - While I can't write the other blog (on self-hosting) any soon due to PC-kun being sus, but can and will be writing the WSL one. (‚Äû‚Ä¢ ÷ä ‚Ä¢‚Äû)
- I JUST WANT TO DO IT AND MAYBE EVERYTHING.. SOMEONE PLEASE ADOPT ME! (oT-T)Â∞∏

- Continuing the book mentioned earlier about JavaScript (too with CS50, why not?); I got to know that in JavaScript "variables" are also called "bindings". Makes sense; "we bind a value to a name that holds that value" - "we just binding a value to a name" ! .\______.
- Ow, due to freakin electricity / power cuts + no internet data, I couldn't take the CS50 today. TwT

- Today, (finally) I started the CS50 journey.. ( ‚Ä¢ÃÄ œâ ‚Ä¢ÃÅ )‚úß
- To be honest, it's so interesting, fascinating, etc., but at first (before even starting anything), kind of confusing and overwhelming.. \~_\~
- Like, there are two sites mentioned: "https://cs50.edx.org/" and "https://cs50.harvard.edu/x", WHICH IS confusing.
- But later got to know that "cs50.edx.org" takes to the "cs50.harvard.edu/x", but the "edx.org" is just (kind of) a platform for hosting courses and it gives "cerified - certificates", but have to pay for it..
- Anyway, still went with "cs50.edx.org" (as it was the first link mentioned under "where to take CS50.."), but it's again, as mentioned, confusing.. like, it doesn't tell you where to start and which one to do first and second and so forth..
- It have all these tabs, links all over the place and I don't know which one to take first and after that.. you know what I mean. Like, just why not put everything in a more intuitive manner?
- Like, wish there was everything in list format or maybe instructions like, "start here, then do this one and then that.. etc.". OR maybe I'm a potato brain just complaining here.. „Äí‚ñΩ„Äí

- Ah! I fell sick (past few days). (ToT)/\~\~\~
- Re-visiting some tutorials. (‚åê‚ñ†_‚ñ†)
- Nothing interesting, but I am really really motivated and full on energy to learn a lot!! b(Ôø£‚ñΩÔø£)d
- What else? Aaaa~! I always forget important things! I want to write things I want to say as soon as they pop in my head, but it's not possible as I don't have access to my computer all the time.
	- So, I might clone this repository (where this **zola** site is) into my phone and as I already got **Termux** installed, I can write from my phone (even though it's pain to write on small-potato phone). ÔºàÔ∏∂^Ô∏∂Ôºâ

- Yesterday finished one of the *8 hour Python tutorial* by **freeCodeCamp** and deployed a weather app as the final project on *render.com*. ( ‚óé‚Éù‚Éò‚àÄ‚óé‚Éù‚Éò )
- And about today, been scrolling through the Python Docs as thinking of working on a project (don't want to tell what it is..). So, I was trying to find (kind of 'research'?) some packages in standard library that can do the job, instead of seeking for 3rd-party ones.ÔΩú‚àí„Éª;Ôºâ
- You know what, at the end, ended up using the 3rd-party library. XD
- Ow, found this amazing website/project called [Open Book Project](https://openbookproject.net/). (‡∑Ü`Íí≥¬¥‡∑Ü)
- There's a lot.. I mean, there are a lot of things to learn and do, but only one life-. ( ÔΩ°_ÔΩ°)

- Aaaah~! Been really into Linux rabit-hole.. to be specific, into self-hosting and stuff. What? (\~Ôø£‚ñΩÔø£)\~
- So, basically, was really into self-hosting and endlessly trying different solutions for it. Like, self-hosting your own git hosting website (i.e. Gitea, GitLab, etc.).
- Had so many trial and errors and FINALLY ended up using **DietPi**. I might write a Blog post about it (soon‚Ñ¢, i don't know..). (lllÔø¢œâÔø¢)
- That's why wasn't able to write (and commit writing) my daily Journal. Also, "cherry on top", my WSL installation broke (i have no idea). That's the another reason not being able to write. (ÔΩ°‚Ä¢ÃÅ-‡∏ÅÃÄÔΩ°)
- Oh, and most important thing for today: I started to read "[Eloquent JavaScript - 4th Edition](https://eloquentjavascript.net/) by **Marijn Haverbeke**. Ÿ©(‚ó¶`Íí≥¬¥‚ó¶)€∂

- I read a book (e-book/pdf) called "An introduction to programming with bash" (by David Both at Opensource.com) today.
- Learnt a new word "*pointy-haired bosses*" - **PHBs**. XD
- A Bash Script to check if a file exists or not and if it exists and is empty or not:

```bash
#!/bin/bash

# First argument must be a filename.
File=$1

if [ -z $1 ] ; then
        echo "Please enter a filename!"
else
        if [ -s $File ] ; then
                echo "'$File' exists and contains data."
        elif [ -e $File ] ; then
                echo "'$File' exists and is empty."
        else
                echo "'$File' does not exist."

- Aaa-! I am not being able to commit to my promises to myself. Like, it's only 4 months in and I am not writing Personal Journals (Offline ones) that I had in my this year's resolutions. (¬¥;œâ;ÔΩÄ)
- Also, I am working in a Python project to do some integrations with VTube Studio and (as mentioned above) using `pyvts` for it. But I don't know where to take it and even what is needed. IT ALREADY SOUNDS CONFUSING, never mind. ( : ‡±¶ ‚Ä∏ ‡±¶ : )

- Today I went into the learning rabbit-hole. Basically it was ML (Machine Learning) and AI (Artificial Intelligent).
- And you know what's the fun part? I got overwhelmed and ended up with 'fried potato' brain. (ÔΩûÔπÉÔΩû)~zZ
- Oh, out of context here, but it's kinda sad that how great people out there make/start something, give their everything to it, just like growing a child. And at the end, they (have to) abandon it.. (¬¥;Ô∏µ;`)

- I was able to figure out everything on my own (‚âß‚àÄ‚â¶). Though, looked online for regular expressions to test it.
- Really feeling proud of myself even though didn't do much today. (‚Äû‚Ä¢ ÷ä ‚Ä¢‚Äû)
- Oh, **Discord** got an updated today and there was "Loot Boxes" thing and the reward was "joker" profile decoration. I think it's April Fool's joke as it at the end mentioned "..you wasted your time opening Lootboxes". (ÔΩ°Ôø´‚àÄÔø©ÔΩ°)
