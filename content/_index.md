- Motivation = ✔
- PC = Nah bruh, let me die.. 凸(￣ヘ￣)
- How do I keep up with CS50 ? (｡T ω T｡)
- Ow, speaking of CS50.. I just remembered something !! (/▿＼ )
- So, when I joined/started the CS50, I also joined their **Discord** and a discussion forum - **CS50x - Ed Discussion**.
    - And as soon as I joined that forum (Ed Discussion), I saw someone anonymous (literally "Anonymous") asked for some help regarding the **WSL** (Windows Subsystem for Linux). o(TヘTo)
    - [{{ img(id="/journal/May 15, 2024/Help regarding WSL posted on CS50 - Ed Discussion by Anonymous.png", alt="Help regarding WSL posted on CS50 - Ed Discussion by Anonymous", title="Help regarding WSL posted on CS50 - Ed Discussion by Anonymous", width="690", height="503", class="center") }}](https://edstem.org/us/courses/176/discussion/4882883)
    - And you know what? |･ω･)
    - I had previously taken the [Introduction to Windows Subsystem for Linux (WSL)](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/training/modules/wsl-introduction/) learning module on **Microsoft Learn** + had learnt about **WSL** from docs + had same/similar issue few years ago AND immediately knew what's wrong and replied them ("Anonymous") with the solution ! 	___〆(・∀・)
    - As expected, it worked for them / the problem solved and they replied with "Thank you..":
    - [{{ img(id="/journal/May 15, 2024/Anonymous replied with Thank you.png", alt="Anonymous replied with Thank you", title="Anonymous replied with Thank you", width="305", height="73", class="center") }}]((https://edstem.org/us/courses/176/discussion/4882883))
    - Aaaaaaaaaaaaaaa- you know the happiness you get when you help someone and the confidence you earn from it !! 	(⁄ ⁄>⁄ ▽ ⁄<⁄ ⁄)
- I might write (kind of) Blog about this problem and solution (maybe it will be helpful for someone or maybe for me in the future) soon™, when I get time.
- So, two Blogs on to-do.. XD
    - While I can't write the other blog (on self-hosting) any soon due to PC-kun being sus, but can and will be writing the WSL one. („• ֊ •„)
- I JUST WANT TO DO IT AND MAYBE EVERYTHING.. SOMEONE PLEASE ADOPT ME! (oT-T)尸

- GOT BACK TO MY PC !! \~\\(≧▽≦)/\~
- A lot happened in between this time (since last wrote Journal and today), but it's waste to write all of those things now (this late). (ヘ･_･)ヘ┳━┳

- Ah!!!!!! ヽ（≧□≦）ノ
- Was so dedicated in the CS50 problem set 0 (aka week 0 problem set). ( •̀ .̫ •́ )✧
- This is the time when you realize the only thing that matters and makes you different is how you think OR maybe what can you think of.. ╮(╯-╰)╭

- Aaaaaaaaggh!!!!!!!!! (⁠╯⁠°⁠□⁠°⁠）⁠╯⁠︵⁠ ⁠┻⁠━⁠┻
- My computer died for no reason.. TwT
- I don't freakin know what happened. Like, literally I opened Visual Studio Code and created a `main.py` file and "boom" -! Like, it played some distorted sound through speakers and then went into blue screen of death and now I can't open my PC. (⁠〒⁠﹏⁠〒⁠)
- ~There is one uncommited change on my computer for the Journal and that is gone too... (⁠•⁠ ⁠▽⁠ ⁠•⁠;⁠)~ Commited on May 13, 2024 !
- I don't know what I will do now.. What do I do? (⁠╥⁠﹏⁠╥⁠)
- My PC & Data gone ! HELP ! (⁠´⁠；⁠ω⁠；⁠｀⁠)

- Continuing the book mentioned earlier about JavaScript (too with CS50, why not?); I got to know that in JavaScript "variables" are also called "bindings". Makes sense; "we bind a value to a name that holds that value" - "we just binding a value to a name" ! .\______.
- Ow, due to freakin electricity / power cuts + no internet data, I couldn't take the CS50 today. TwT
- Life is unfair and only if you care (ˉ▽ˉ；)... wat?

- Today, (finally) I started the CS50 journey.. ( •̀ ω •́ )✧
- To be honest, it's so interesting, fascinating, etc., but at first (before even starting anything), kind of confusing and overwhelming.. \~_\~
- Like, there are two sites mentioned: "https://cs50.edx.org/" and "https://cs50.harvard.edu/x", WHICH IS confusing.
- But later got to know that "cs50.edx.org" takes to the "cs50.harvard.edu/x", but the "edx.org" is just (kind of) a platform for hosting courses and it gives "cerified - certificates", but have to pay for it..
- Anyway, still went with "cs50.edx.org" (as it was the first link mentioned under "where to take CS50.."), but it's again, as mentioned, confusing.. like, it doesn't tell you where to start and which one to do first and second and so forth..
- It have all these tabs, links all over the place and I don't know which one to take first and after that.. you know what I mean. Like, just why not put everything in a more intuitive manner?
- Like, wish there was everything in list format or maybe instructions like, "start here, then do this one and then that.. etc.". OR maybe I'm a potato brain just complaining here.. 〒▽〒

- Ah! I fell sick (past few days). (ToT)/\~\~\~
- Re-visiting some tutorials. (⌐■_■)
- Nothing interesting, but I am really really motivated and full on energy to learn a lot!! b(￣▽￣)d
- What else? Aaaa~! I always forget important things! I want to write things I want to say as soon as they pop in my head, but it's not possible as I don't have access to my computer all the time.
	- So, I might clone this repository (where this **zola** site is) into my phone and as I already got **Termux** installed, I can write from my phone (even though it's pain to write on small-potato phone). （︶^︶）

- Yesterday finished one of the *8 hour Python tutorial* by **freeCodeCamp** and deployed a weather app as the final project on *render.com*. ( ◎⃝⃘∀◎⃝⃘ )
- And about today, been scrolling through the Python Docs as thinking of working on a project (don't want to tell what it is..). So, I was trying to find (kind of 'research'?) some packages in standard library that can do the job, instead of seeking for 3rd-party ones.｜−・;）
- You know what, at the end, ended up using the 3rd-party library. XD
- Ow, found this amazing website/project called [Open Book Project](https://openbookproject.net/). (ෆ`꒳´ෆ)
- There's a lot.. I mean, there are a lot of things to learn and do, but only one life-. ( ｡_｡)

- Aaaah~! Been really into Linux rabit-hole.. to be specific, into self-hosting and stuff. What? (\~￣▽￣)\~
- So, basically, was really into self-hosting and endlessly trying different solutions for it. Like, self-hosting your own git hosting website (i.e. Gitea, GitLab, etc.).
- Had so many trial and errors and FINALLY ended up using **DietPi**. I might write a Blog post about it (soon™, i don't know..). (lll￢ω￢)
- That's why wasn't able to write (and commit writing) my daily Journal. Also, "cherry on top", my WSL installation broke (i have no idea). That's the another reason not being able to write. (｡•́-ก̀｡)
- Oh, and most important thing for today: I started to read "[Eloquent JavaScript - 4th Edition](https://eloquentjavascript.net/) by **Marijn Haverbeke**. ٩(◦`꒳´◦)۶

- I swear to god, I don't remember any time when I felt this useless and hopeless at the same time. (٭°̧̧̧꒳°̧̧̧٭) 
- I feel like crying aloud while banging my head on the wall..（ ; ; ）
- What else is left in this world? 

> {{ date_format_journal(date="2024-04-07T23:54:43") }}

- I read a book (e-book/pdf) called "An introduction to programming with bash" (by David Both at Opensource.com) today.
- Learnt a new word "*pointy-haired bosses*" - **PHBs**. XD
- A Bash Script to check if a file exists or not and if it exists and is empty or not:

```bash
#!/bin/bash

# First argument must be a filename.
File=$1

if [ -z $1 ] ; then
        echo "Please enter a filename!"
else
        if [ -s $File ] ; then
                echo "'$File' exists and contains data."
        elif [ -e $File ] ; then
                echo "'$File' exists and is empty."
        else
                echo "'$File' does not exist."
        fi
fi
```

- Made just a minor contribution to an open-source project called `pyvts`. It was just fixing typo in docs.. (＞▽＜)
- Aaa-! I am not being able to commit to my promises to myself. Like, it's only 4 months in and I am not writing Personal Journals (Offline ones) that I had in my this year's resolutions. (´;ω;｀)
- Also, I am working in a Python project to do some integrations with VTube Studio and (as mentioned above) using `pyvts` for it. But I don't know where to take it and even what is needed. IT ALREADY SOUNDS CONFUSING, never mind. ( : ౦ ‸ ౦ : )
- Wah~.. forgot to mention important one for today: I came to know about this Gaming Engine - [Cocos](https://www.cocos.com/en). (☆▽☆)
- Like think for a moment; how many cool and amazing things exists in this world and we don't even have time to explore or even get to know them. Only one life feels so stupid to have..god~ I wanna do everything! (｡•́-ก̀｡)

- Today I went into the learning rabbit-hole. Basically it was ML (Machine Learning) and AI (Artificial Intelligent).
- And you know what's the fun part? I got overwhelmed and ended up with 'fried potato' brain. (～﹃～)~zZ
- Oh, out of context here, but it's kinda sad that how great people out there make/start something, give their everything to it, just like growing a child. And at the end, they (have to) abandon it.. (´;︵;`)

- Aaaaaa-! I created [**Bash Scripts**](https://github.com/Nerdsomeness/Blog/tree/main/scripts) to kinda automate the entry/creation of Journal and Blog and it kinda cool how everything makes sense.
- I was able to figure out everything on my own (≧∀≦). Though, looked online for regular expressions to test it.
- Really feeling proud of myself even though didn't do much today. („• ֊ •„)
- Oh, **Discord** got an updated today and there was "Loot Boxes" thing and the reward was "joker" profile decoration. I think it's April Fool's joke as it at the end mentioned "..you wasted your time opening Lootboxes". (｡￫∀￩｡)

- Finally, today deployed my **Zola** Blog/Journal to **GitHub Pages**.
- Ah, it shouldn't be that much headache if **GitHub** hadn't flagged my account. (°ー°〃)
- Wait, it's "April 1st" and I'm being serious as -! xD
- Also, there are a lot of things needs to be done in this site.. like, the translation button- Ahm- nm. (´ｰ∀ｰ`)
