Well, I'm not an expert (in any way) that can guide you through this, so I'm going to tell you about How did I learn Programming or how even I got into this. Hope it will motivate you to start to learn Programming in 2024 as 2023 is about to end.

But wait a minute. What even is Programming? Well, to my understanding, **Programming is about giving computer instructions to do a specific task (without mistakes)**. Now that you know what it is, let's get into the actual thing:

## How have I gotten into Programming?

Back in 2018 (June 13), I joined an instant messaging social platform called Discord. When I signed up for it, I had no idea what it really is and even how to use it. But out of curiosity, I created an account. There were no one to talk at that time, and I even forgot that I had an account on Discord. Then during the pandemic, I somehow got back to it (like everyone else during that time). If I remember correctly, it was late 2020. I was exploring the platform for the first time. I even got some friends to talk. And then I came to know about Discord Bots & Discord Developer Portal. It was so fascinating to know that you can create your own Discord Bots. That was the moment where it all started... wait, no! Let me take you a step back:

### Childhood memory of first time getting curious about Programming in-general.

During Winter vacations, I was in my uncle's home. One day, going through his library of books, I found a Computer Science (I guess) book. And it was all in English. English isn't my mother tongue and little me didn't even know much English at that time. Though I'm keep learning and improved so much since then. Anyway, back to the topic. As me couldn't understand a single thing, I asked my uncle what it is? He told me something-something that I don't remember anything. But then he told me that he will teach me HTML and then later XML. To my understanding, from what he told me, I got that these were Programming languages. But no, these are Markup Languages, not Programming! Anyway. HTML & XML were in his school course, so I got lucky there (I'm a biology student btw). It was all starting, but unfortunately, Winter vacations were not enough for me to learn something. 

{{ img(id="A Textbook of Information Technology - Book Cover.jpg", alt='The book "Early Information Technology (A Textbook of Information Technology)" I mentioned here.', title='The book "Early Information Technology (A Textbook of Information Technology)" I mentioned here.', class="float-left", width="240" ) }}

Skipping to a year or so; During the vacations, I insisted my grandfather to buy the HTML book (this time in my native language). We searched for the book in the whole town till sunset (it's hard to find Programming related books here in languages other than English), but you guessed it... we couldn't find one. All books were in English and as I told you, little me didn't know English. But, when we were heading home, we did a last try in a Book shop... and finally. Finally, we got one HTML book. I went through that HTML book for months. And honestly, writing HTML in notepad and displaying "This is My First HTML Document" in different headings & styles on Internet Explorer wasn't that fun. So, I went completely away from it as I got busy with my studies as I advanced to the next classes (I'm a biology student btw). Anyway, that really was the moment or the first time I got interested in Programming or you can say, got into Programming (even though HTML isn't really a Programming language).

Now, going back to where we left, the Discord Bots & Discord Developer Portal era. Knowing nothing, like everyone else, I searched on YouTube; "How to create my own Discord Bot?". By the way, why kids now-a-days (prefer to) search everything on YouTube instead of Google? Anyway, back to the topic (LOL). Well... it didn't help that much as there were tons of videos showing how to create Discord Bot using various different Programming languages (lol, JavaScript & Python only) and various other libraries. And I was like, "Why so many options? I just want to create my Discord Bot. Why isn't there only one (and simple) path to achieve this?". I also had no idea about neither JavaScript, nor Python. Then I did the same search on Google this time with one more word; "How to create my own simple Discord Bot?". And I came across a site or it was more like a personal blog (I lost the bookmark to it due to technical issues and if I remember correctly, it wasn't available last time I visited it. Means, sadly they removed the blog) which taught me how to make Discord Bot in Python using Discord.py in a very simple and intuitive way. And I had a Bot up and running which just replies with "Hello". It really made me so happy and felt like I wasn't this much happy in my entire life. Though it was nothing and they provided a button to copy and paste the code, but I really typed all the code even after that. So, that was the first time I really started to learn & write a real Programming language.

## What I really learned? Did I master Python or Programming?

Speaking of present, I did read few books on Python Programming language and no, I didn't master the Python Programming language, but what I really learned from the past and the real story I shared with you; about me getting into Programming and developing interest into it; is: how you learn something or in my case Programming, really matters and effects the knowledge you gain about it. I'm sorry as I'm not able to really say what I want to say. I don't know how to phrase it. So, let's give it another try:

### Best approach to learn Programming?

Till this point, you might be thinking that the title of this post is just a click bait. I'm sorry! I hope you are still here and read to this point. So, let's get to the main point of this post: What is the best approach to learn programming? From the past, I learned that learning by actually doing is the best and I'll argue that the only way to learn Programming. Why? Again, I will not be able to tell exactly what I want to say. Ah, let's try to understand by an example!

Imagine if I had not got to know about Discord Bots and didn't even get passionate about creating one for myself, will I even had gotten into Programming in the first place? Without any IT background, I don't think so (I'm a biology student btw). Because of that, I knew what I wanted (creating my own Discord Bot) and I just needed the right tools to accomplish that. Means, the motive and path were clear. I decided that the Python was the right tool to do what I want. And I got pretty good understanding of Python for creating Discord Bots and how the Discord Bots work, etc. I created several Bots and kind of got familiar with the tools and Programming. On the other hand, If I had, even after deciding that I want to create a Discord Bot, chosen the sort-of traditional way (?) or what most of the people do; learning Programming fundamentals, going through Computer Science courses and then deciding to learn a Programming language, I don't think I ever would have been able to create my own Discord bot. I would have given up on Programming so early. And I would have been still watching tutorials and seeking for courses (*the Tutorial's Rabbit Hole* OR *Tutorial Hell*) till this point.

I just want to emphasize the importance of Project based learning, learning by doing here. It's the best way to step into Programming and from there you can learn more and more as you encounter things while working on your project(s) rather than deciding on what to learn first in Programming. But as a coin has to sides, walking through this approach also have its own downsides. Whether it's true or not, sometimes things work, and you don't know why it works. You focus on project so much that you forget to actually learn things and ended up copy-pasting code from online. So, being conscious and enjoying the process is very important.

## Source: Trust me bro!

In the conclusion, all I shared in the last is based on my personal experience and opinion, thus it doesn't mean a professional advice in any way. Most of it doesn't even make sense (LOL). Anyway, I realized it while trying to learn C++ Programming language in traditional way as I mentioned before, and I found myself jumping from one tutorial to another, reading through one book and another without seeing any progress at all towards my goal. That's why I thought of sharing it with the internet. A place I can look back to whenever I need to, or I get sidetracked in the Tutorial's Rabbit Hole. By the way, my purpose to learn C++ is to be able to create VST (Instrument & Effect) plugins. So, I'll take my own words & advice into account and from now on I'll be following the project-based path towards learning the C++ and of course let you know about the progress through my blog. Though, it's not going to happen soon as my PC right now isn't that good to do build & test VST plugins as it even lags in simple Python programs on VS Code.

*Anyway, I hope you like it, and it inspired you to get up and start learning something new today. Till then, goodbye!*
